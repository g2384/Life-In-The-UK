In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, if an accused person is aged **10 to 17**, the case is normally heard in a **Youth Court** in front of up to three specially trained **magistrates** or a **District Judge**. The most serious cases will go the **Crown Court**. In **Scotland** a system called the **Childrenâ€™s Hearings System** is used to deal with children and young people who have committed an offence.

**Members of the public** are not allowed in Youth Courts, and the **name or photographs** of the accused young person cannot be published in newspapers or used by the media.
