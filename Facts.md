During the First World War millions of people were killed or wounded, with more than **2 million** British casualties.

The **Normans** used a system of land ownership known as **feudalism**.

During the **Bronze** Age people lived in **roundhouses** and buried their dead in tombs called **round barrows**.

**Catherine Howard** was a **cousin** of **Anne Boleyn**.

**Stone Age**: The first people to live in Britain were **hunter-gatherers**.

Throughout the 1990s, Britain played a leading role in coalition forces involved in the liberation of Kuwait, following the Iraqi invasion in 1990, and the conflict in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.

In the Middle Ages, **Knights**, who were usually **smaller landowners**, and **wealthy people** from towns and cities were elected to sit in the **House of Commons**.

During the Middle Ages, England was an important trading nation and people came to England from abroad to trade and also to work. Many had special skills:
- weavers from France,
- engineers from Germany,
- glass manufacturers from Italy
- and canal builders from Holland.

The Parliament developed in Scotland in the Middle Ages had three Houses, called **Estates**:
- the lords,
- the commons
- and the clergy.

The Middle Ages (or the medieval period) was a time of almost **constant war**.

In the Middle Ages, the numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts, known as **Houses** were established. These were the House of the **Commons** and the House of the **Lords**.

During the Middle Ages, **great landowners** and **bishops** sat in the House of **Lords**.

**Lincoln Cathedral** was built in the middle ages.

At the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland was an independent country.

During the middle ages, several cathedrals had windows of stained glass, telling stories about the **Bible** and **Christian saints**. The glass in **York Minster** is a famous example.

Anne Boleyn was executed at the tower of London.

Catherine of Aragon was a Spanish princess.

Following the Black Death, the smaller population meant there was less need to grow cereal crops. There were **labour shortages** and peasants began to demand **higher wages**. New social classes appeared, including **owners of large areas of land** (later called the **gentry**), and people left the countryside to live in the towns. In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a **strong middle class**.

Queen Mary was a devout **Catholic** and persecuted **Protestants** (for this reason, she became known as ‘Bloody Mary’).

In the **late 1970s**, the post-war economic boom came to an end.

The **Great Western Railway** was the first major railway built in Britain.

English kings fought a long war with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted **116** years).

To divorce his first wife, Henry VIII needed the approval of the **Pope**. When the Pope refused, Henry established the **Church of England**. In this new church, the **king**, not the Pope, would have the power to appoint bishops and order how people should worship.

The symbol of the House of **Tudor** was a red rose with a white rose inside it as a sign that the Houses of York and Lancaster were now allies.

The Battle of **Hastings** is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known as the **Bayeux tapestry**, which can still be seen in **France** today. The Bayeux Tapestry is nearly **70 metres (230 feet)** long and is embroidered with coloured wool.

During the Victorian period, the British Empire grew to cover all of India, Australia and large parts of Africa. It became the largest empire the world has ever seen, with an estimated population of more than **400 million** people.

# Economy

Although the UK had won the war, the country was exhausted economically after WWII.

For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment by their employer and paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the government department that collects taxes. This system is called **“Pay As You Earn” (PAYE)**.

Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.

# Culture

Words such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe come from the Viking languages.

‘PDSA’ stands for People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals.

The public can listen to debates in the Palace of Westminster from **public galleries** in both the **House of Commons** and the **House of Lords**.

Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on television and published in official reports called **Hansard**.

Vaccinations and medical treatment for animals are available from veterinary surgeons (vets).

People in the UK are living longer than ever before. This is due to improved living standards and better health care. There are now a record number of people aged 85 and over. This has an impact on the cost of **pensions** and **health care**.

Some words in modern English – for example, ‘park’ and ‘beauty’ – are based on Norman French words.

Giving blood only takes about **an hour** to do.

Donated blood is used by hospitals to help people with a wide range of **injuries** and **illnesses**.

# A Long and Illustrious History

## Early Britain

### Stone Age

- hunter-gatherers: the first people to live in Britain.
- For much of the Stone Age, Britain was connected to the
continent by a **land bridge**. People came and went, following the herds of
deer and horses which they hunted.
- The first farmers built houses, tombs and monuments on the land.
- Survived Stone Age sites:
  - **Stonehenge** (a monument, World Heritage Site), still stands in what is now the English county of **Wiltshire**. Stonehenge was probably a special gathering place for **seasonal ceremonies**.
  - **Skara Brae on Orkney**, off the **north** coast of **Scotland**, is the best preserved prehistoric village in northern Europe, and has helped archaeologists to understand more about how people lived near the end of the Stone Age. 

### Bronze Age

- People lived in **roundhouses** and buried their dead in tombs called **round barrows**.
- The people were accomplished metalworkers who made many beautiful objects in bronze and gold, including tools, ornaments and weapons.

### Iron

- people learned how to make weapons and tools out of iron.
- People still lived in **roundhouses** grouped together into **larger settlements**, and sometimes defended sites called **hill forts**.
- A very impressive hill fort can still be seen today at **Maiden Castle**, in the English county of **Dorset**. 
- Most people were **farmers, craft workers or warriors**.
- The language they spoke was part of the **Celtic** language family. Similar languages were spoken across Europe in the Iron Age and related languages are still spoken today in some parts of Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
- The people of the Iron Age had a sophisticated culture and economy. They made the **first coins** to be minted in Britain, some inscribed with the **names of Iron Age kings**. This marks the beginnings of British history. 

### The Romans

- In AD 43 the Emperor Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion. The Romans were successful in occupying almost all of Britain.
- Boudicca (a tribal leader, the queen of the Iceni in what is now eastern England) fought against the Romans. She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on **Westminster Bridge in London**, near the Houses of Parliament.
- **Scotland** were never conquered by the Romans.
- The Emperor **Hadrien** built a wall in the north of England to keep out the **Picts** (ancestors of the Scottish people). Included in the wall were a number of forts. Parts of Hadrien’s Wall, including the forts of **Housesteads** and **Vindolanda**, can still be seen. It is a popular area for walkers and is a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site.
- The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and introduced new plants and animals.

### The Anglo-Saxons

- Britain was again invaded by tribes from northern Europe:
  - the Jutes,
  - the Angles
  - and the Saxons.
- The languages they spoke are the basis of modern-day English.
- Sutton Hoo's (an Anglo-Saxon king) burial place is in modern Suffolk. This king was buried with treasure and armour, all placed in a **ship** which was then covered by a mound of earth.
- Parts of the west of Britain, including much of what is now Wales, and Scotland, remained free of Anglo-Saxon rule.
- The Anglo-Saxons were not Christians when they first came to Britain but, during this period, **missionaries** came to Britain to preach about Christianity.
- Missionaries from Ireland spread the religion in the north:
  - **St Patrick**, who would become the patron saint of Ireland,
  - **St Columba**, who founded a monastery on the island of Iona, off the coast of what is now Scotland.
  - **St Augustine** led missionaries from Rome, who spread Christianity in the south. St Augustine became the **first Archbishop of Canterbury**.

### The Vikings

- The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under **King Alfred the Great**, who defeated the Vikings.
- Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain – especially in the east and north of England in an area known as the **Danelaw** (many place names there, such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe come from the Viking languages).
- The Viking settlers mixed with local communities and some converted to Christianity.
- Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England, except for a short
period when there were Danish kings. The first of these was **Cnut**, also
named **Canute**.
- In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged the people to unite under one king, **Kenneth MacAlpin**. The term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.

## The Norman Conquest

- The Battle of Hastings in 1066 is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known as the **Bayeux Tapestry** (70 metres (230 feet) long, colored wool), which can still be seen in France today. 
- The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England and led to many changes in government and social structures in England.
- Norman French, the language of the new ruling class influenced the development of the English language as we know it today.
- Initially the Normans also conquered Wales, but the Welsh gradually won territory back.
- The Scots and the Normans fought on the border between England and Scotland; the Normans took over some land on the border but did not invade Scotland.
- **Domesday Book**: William sent people all over England to draw up lists of all the towns and villages. The people who lived there, who owned the land and what animals they owned were also listed. It still exists today and gives a picture of society in England just after the Norman Conquest.

## The Middle Ages

### War at home and abroad

- Middle Ages (or the medieval period):
  - end of the Roman Empire in AD 476 - 1485 (Broadly speaking).
  - the Norman Conquest (1066) - 1485 (the focus here).
- It was a time of almost constant war.
- The English kings fought with the Welsh, Scottish and Irish noblemen for
control of their lands.
- In Wales, the English were able to establish their rule.
  - By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been defeated.
  - English laws and the English language were introduced.
- Scotland remained unconquered by the English.
- At the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland was an independent country. The English first went to Ireland as troops to **help** the Irish king and remained to build their own settlements.
- During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad:
  - Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the **Holy Land**.
  - English kings also fought a long war with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years).

### Feudalism

- The Normans used a system of land ownership known as **feudalism**. The king gave land to his lords in return for help in war. Landowners had to send certain numbers of men to serve in the army. Some **peasants** had their own land but most were **serfs**. They had a small area of their lord’s land where they could grow food. In return, they had to work for their lord and could not move away.
- The same system developed in southern Scotland. In the north of Scotland and Ireland, land was owned by members of the **‘clans’** (prominent families).

### The Black Death

- In 1348, **1/3** of the population of England died and a similar proportion in Scotland and Wales.
- This was one of the worst disasters ever to strike Britain.
- Following the Black Death, the smaller population meant there was less need to grow **cereal crops**.
- There were **labour shortages** and peasants began to demand higher wages.
- New social classes appeared, including owners of large areas of land (later called the **gentry**), and people left the countryside to live in the towns. In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a strong **middle class**.
- In Ireland, the Black Death killed many in the **Pale** and, for a time, the area controlled by the English became **smaller**.

### Legal and political changes

- In the Middle Ages, Parliament began to develop into the institution it is today. Its origins can be traced to the king’s council of advisers, which included important **noblemen** and the **leaders of the Church**.
- In England, parliaments were called for the king to consult his nobles, particularly when the king needed to raise money. The numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts, known as Houses, were established.
- House of Lords:
  - nobility
  - great landowners
  - bishops
- House of Commons (elected)
  - Knights, who were usually smaller landowners
  - wealthy people from towns and cities
- Only a small part of the population was able to join in electing the members of the Commons.
- A similar Parliament developed in Scotland. It had three Houses, called **Estates**:
  - the lords
  - the commons
  - the clergy
- This was also a time of development in the legal system. The principle that judges are independent of the government began to be established.
- In England, judges developed ‘common law’ by a process of **precedence** (that is, following previous decisions) and tradition.
- In Scotland, the legal system developed slightly differently and laws were ‘codified’ (that is, written down).

### A distinct identity

- English: graduallly combined by Norman French (spoken by the king and his noblemen) and Anglo-Saxon (spoken by peasants) after the Norman Conquest.
- Norman French words: ‘park’ and ‘beauty’
- Anglo-Saxon words: ‘apple’, ‘cow’ and ‘summer’
- In modern English there are often two words with very similar meanings, one from French and one from AngloSaxon. ‘Demand’ (French) and ‘ask’ (Anglo-Saxon) are examples.
- Canterbury Tales was one of the first books to be printed by **William Caxton**, the first person in England to print books using a printing press. Many of the stories are still popular. Some have been made into plays and television programmes.
- In Scotland, many people continued to speak Gaelic and the Scots language also developed. A number of poets began to write in the Scots language. One example is **John Barbour**, who wrote *The Bruce* about the Battle of **Bannockburn**.
- Castles were built in many places in Britain and Ireland, partly for **defence**. Today many are in ruins, although some, such as **Windsor** and **Edinburgh**, are still in use.
- Great cathedrals – for example, **Lincoln Cathedral** – were also built, and many of these are still used for worship.
- Several of the cathedrals had windows of stained glass, telling stories about the **Bible and Christian saints.** The glass in **York Minster** is a famous example.
- England was an important trading nation. English **wool** became a very important export.
- People came to England from abroad to trade and also to work. Many had special skills, such as:
  - weavers from France
  - engineers from Germany
  - glass manufacturers from Italy
  - canal builders from Holland

### The Wars of the Roses

- 1455 - 1485.
- House of Lancaster - House of York

![The roses of The Wars of the Roses](./images/4-6.jpg)

## The Tudors and Stuarts

### Henry VII

- After Wars of the Roses, Henry VII wanted to make sure that England remained peaceful and that his position as king was secure. He deliberately strengthened the central administration of England and reduced the power of the nobles.
- He was thrifty and built up the monarchy’s financial reserves.

### Henry VIII (son)

- Henry VIII continued the policy of centralising power.
- Henry VIII was most famous for breaking away from the Church of Rome and marrying six times:

|Name|From|Children|Notes|

- To divorce his first wife, Henry needed the approval of the Pope. When the Pope refused, Henry established the **Church of England**.
- In this new church, the **king**, not the Pope, would have the power to appoint bishops and order how people should worship.
- At the same time the **Reformation** was happening across Europe. This was a movement against the authority of the Pope and the ideas and practices of the Roman Catholic Church.
- The **Protestants** formed their own churches.
  - They read the Bible in their own languages instead of Latin;
  - they did not pray to saints or at shrines;
  - and they believed that a person’s own relationship with God was more important than submitting to the authority of the Church.
- During the reign of Henry VIII, Wales became formally united with England by the **Act for the Government of Wales**. The Welsh sent representatives to the House of Commons and the Welsh legal system was reformed.

### Edward VI (son)

- Edward VI was strongly Protestant. During his reign, the **Book of Common Prayer** was written to be used in the Church of England. A version of this book is still used in some churches today.
- Edward died at the age of 15 after ruling for just over six years.

### Mary (half-sister)
- Mary was a devout Catholic and persecuted Protestants (for this reason, she became known as ‘Bloody
Mary’).
- Mary also died after a short reign.

### Elizabeth (half-sister)

- Elizabeth I was the younger daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.
- Queen Elizabeth I was a Protestant. She re-established the Church of England as the official Church of England. Everyone had to attend their local church and there were laws about the type of religious services and the prayers which could be said, but Elizabeth did not ask about people’s real beliefs. She succeeded in finding a balance between the views of the Catholics and the more extreme Protestants. In this way, she avoided any serious religious conflict within England.
- She never married.

### The Reformation in Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots

- The queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart (often now called ‘Mary, Queen of Scots’) was a Catholic.
- She was only a week old when her father died and she became queen. Much of her childhood was spent in **France**.
- When she returned to Scotland, she was the centre of a power struggle between different groups. When her husband was murdered, Mary was suspected of involvement and fled to England. She gave her throne to her Protestant son, James VI of Scotland.
- Mary was Elizabeth I’s cousin and hoped that Elizabeth might help her, but Elizabeth suspected Mary of wanting to take over the English throne, and kept her prisoner for **20** years. Mary was eventually executed, accused of plotting against Elizabeth I.

### James I (cousin)

- James VI Scotland, Elizabeth's cousin, became King James I of England, Wales and Ireland. Scotland remained a separate country.
- The King James Bible: One achievement of King James’ reign was a new translation of the Bible into English. This translation is known as the **‘King James Version’** or the **‘Authorised Version’**. It was not the first English Bible but is a version which continues to be used in many Protestant churches today.

### Ireland
- During this period, Ireland was an almost completely Catholic country. Henry VII and Henry VIII had extended English control outside the Pale and had established English authority over the whole country.
- Henry VIII took the title ‘King of Ireland’. English laws were introduced and local leaders were expected to follow the instructions of the Lord **Lieutenants** in Dublin.
- During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, many people in Ireland opposed rule by the Protestant government in England. There were a number of rebellions. The English government encouraged Scottish and English Protestants to settle in **Ulster**, the northern province of Ireland, taking over the land from Catholic landholders. These settlements were known as **plantations**. Many of the new settlers came from south-west Scotland and other land was given to companies based in London.
- James later organised similar plantations in several other parts of Ireland. This had serious longterm consequence for the history of England, Scotland and Ireland.

### The rise of Parliament

- Elizabeth I was very skilled at managing Parliament. During her reign, she was successful in balancing her wishes and views against those of the House of Lords and those of the House of Commons, which was increasingly Protestant in its views.
- James I and his son **Charles I** were less skilled politically. Both believed in the **‘Divine Right of Kings’**: the idea that the king was directly appointed by God to rule. They thought that the king should be able to act without having to seek approval from Parliament. When Charles I inherited the thrones of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, he tried to rule in line with this principle. When he could not get Parliament to agree with his religious and foreign policies, he tried to rule without the Parliament at all. For 11 years, he found ways in which to raise money without Parliament’s approval but eventually trouble in Scotland meant that he had to recall Parliament.

### The beginning of the English Civil War

- Charles I wanted the worship of the Church of England to include more ceremony and introduced a revise **Prayer Book**. He tried to impose this Prayer Book on the Presbyterian Church in Scotland and this led to serious unrest.
- A Scottish army was formed and Charles could not find the money he needed for his own army without the help of Parliament.
- In 1640, he recalled Parliament to ask it for funds. Many in Parliament were **Puritans**, a group of Protestants who advocated strict and simple religious doctrine and worship. They did not agree with the king’s religious views and disliked his reforms of the Church of England. Parliament refused to give the king the money he asked for, even after the Scottish army invaded England. 
- Another rebellion began in Ireland because the Roman Catholics in Ireland were afraid of the growing power of the Puritans. Parliament took this opportunity to demand control of the English army – a change that would have transferred substantial power from the king to Parliament. In response, Charles I entered the House of Commons and tried to arrest five parliamentary leaders, but they had been warned and were not there. (No monarch has set foot in the Commons since.)
- Civil war between the king and Parliament began in 1642. The country spilt into those who supported the king (the Cavaliers) and those who supported Parliament (the Roundheads). 

### Oliver Cromwell and the English republic

- Oliver Cromwell was the leader of the English republic
- The king’s army was defeated at the Battles of **Marston Moor** and **Naseby**.
- By 1646, it was clear that the Parliament had won the war.
- Charles was held prisoner by the parliamentary army. He was still unwilling to reach any agreement with the Parliament and in 1649 he was executed.
- England declared itself a republic, called the Commonwealth. It no longer had a monarch. For a time, it was not totally clear how the country would be governed. For now, the army was in control. 
- One of its generals, Oliver Cromwell, was sent to Ireland, where the revolt which had begun in 1641 still continued and where there was still a Royalist army. Cromwell was successful in establishing the authority of the English Parliament but did this with such violence that even today Cromwell remains a controversial figure in Ireland.
- The Scots had not agreed to the execution of Charles I and declared his son **Charles II** to be king. He was crowned king of Scotland and led a Scottish army into England. Cromwell defeated this army in the Battles of **Dunbar** and **Worcester**. Charles II escaped from Worcester, famously hiding in an oak tree on one occasion, and eventually fled to Europe.
- Parliament now controlled Scotland as well as England and Wales.
- After his campaign in Ireland and victory over Charles II at Worcester, Cromwell was recognised as the leader of the new republic. He was given the title of **Lord Protector** and ruled until his death in 1658.
- When Cromwell died, his son, Richard, became Lord Protector in his place but was not able to control the army or the government. Although Britain had been a republic for **11** years, without Oliver Cromwell there was no clear leader or system of government. Many people in the country wanted stability. People began to talk about the need for a king.

### Charles II

- In May 1660, Parliament invited Charles II to come back from exile in The Netherlands. He was crowned King Charles II of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Charles II made it clear that he had ‘no wish to go on his travels again’.
- He understood that he could not always do as he wished but would sometimes need to reach agreement with the Parliament. Generally, Parliament supported his policies. The Church of England again became the established official Church. Both Roman Catholics and Puritans were kept out of power.
- Charles II was interested in science. During his reign, the **Royal Society** was formed to promote ‘natural knowledge’. This is the oldest surviving scientific society in the world. Among its early members were **Sir Edmund Halley** who successfully predicted the return of the comet now called Halley’s Comet, and Sir Isaac Newton.
- Charles II had no legitimate children. He died in 1685.

### James II, A Catholic king

- Charles II's brother, James, who was a Roman Catholic, became King James II in England, Wales and Ireland and King James VII of Scotland.
- James favoured Roman Catholics and allowed them to be army officers, which an Act of Parliament had forbidden. He did not seek to reach agreements with Parliament and arrested some of the bishops of the Church of England. People in England worried that James wanted to make England a Catholic country once more.
- However, his heirs were his two daughters, who were both firmly Protestant, and people thought that this meant there would soon be a Protestant monarch again. Then James’s wife had a son. Suddenly, it seemed likely that the next monarch would not be a Protestant after all.

### William III, The Glorious Revolution

- James II’s elder daughter, Mary, was married to her cousin William of Orange, the Protestant ruler of the Netherlands.
- In 1688, important Protestants in England asked William to invade England and proclaim himself king. When William reached England, there was no resistance. James fled to France and William took over the throne, becoming William III in England, Wales and Ireland, and William II of Scotland. William ruled jointly with Mary. This event was later called the **‘Glorious Revolution’** because there was no fighting in England and because it guaranteed the power of Parliament, ending the threat of monarch ruling on his or her own as he or she wished.
- James II wanted to regain the throne and invaded Ireland with the help of a French army. William defeated James II at the Battle of the **Boyne** in **Ireland** in 1690, an event which is still celebrated by some in Northern Ireland today.
- William re-conquered Ireland and James fled back to France.
- Many restrictions were placed on the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland and Irish Catholics were unable to take part in the government.
- There was also support for James in Scotland. An attempt at an armed rebellion in support of James was quickly defeated at **Killiecrankie**. All Scottish clans were required formally to accept William as king by taking an oath.
- The **MacDonalds of Glencoe** were late in taking an oath and were killed. The memory of this massacre meant some Scots distrusted the new government.
- Some continued to believe that James was the rightful king, particularly in Scotland. Some joined him in exile in France; others were secret supporters. James’ supporters became known as **Jacobites**. 

## A global power

### Constitutional monarchy – the Bill of Rights

- **Declaration of Rights** was read at the coronation of William and Mary. This confirmed that the king would no longer be able to raise taxes and administer justice without agreement from Parliament. The balance of power between monarch and Parliament had now permanently changed.
- **The Bill of Rights**, 1689, confirmed the rights of Parliament and the limits of the king’s power. Parliament took control of who could be monarch and declared that the king or queen must be a **Protestant**. A new Parliament had to be elected at least every **three** years (later this became **seven** years and now it is **five** years). Every year the monarch had to ask Parliament to renew funding for the army and the navy.
- These changes meant that, to be able to govern effectively, the monarch needed to have advisers, or ministers, who would be able to ensure a majority of votes in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
- There were two main groups in Parliament, known as the **Whigs** and the **Tories**. (The modern Conservative Party is still sometimes referred to as the Tories.)
- This was the beginning of party politics.
- This was also an important time for the development of a **free press** (newspapers and other publications which are not controlled by the government). From 1695, newspapers were allowed to operate without a government licence. Increasing numbers of newspapers began to be published.
- The laws passed after the Glorious Revolution are the beginning of what is called **‘constitutional monarchy’**. The monarch remained very important but was no longer able to insist on particular policies or actions if Parliament did not agree.
- After William III, the ministers gradually became more important than the monarch but this was not a democracy in the modern sense.
- The number of people who had the right to vote for members of Parliament was still very small. Only men who owned property of a certain value were able to vote. No women at all had the vote.
- Some constituencies were controlled by a single wealthy family. They were called the **‘pocket boroughs’**. Other constituencies had hardly any voters and were called **‘rotten boroughs’**.

### A growing population

- This was a time when many people left Britain and Ireland to settle in new colonies in America and elsewhere, but others came to live in Britain.
- The first Jews to come to Britain since the Middle Ages settled in London in 1656.
- Between 1680 and 1720 many refugees called **Huguenots** came from France. They were Protestants and had been persecuted for their religion. Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in banking, or in weaving or other crafts.

### The Act or Treaty of Union in Scotland

- William and Mary’s successor, Queen Anne, had no surviving children. This created uncertainty over the succession in England, Wales and Ireland and in Scotland.
- The Act of Union, known as the Treaty of Union in Scotland, was therefore agreed in 1707, creating the Kingdom of Great Britain. Although Scotland was no longer an independent country, it kept its own legal and education systems and Presbyterian Church.

### George I & The Prime Minister

- When Queen Anne died in 1714, Parliament chose a German, George I, to be the next king, because he was Anne’s nearest Protestant relative.
- An attempt by Scottish Jacobites to put James II’s son on the throne instead was quickly defeated. George I did not speak very good English and this increased his need to rely on his ministers. The most important minister in Parliament became known as the **Prime Minister**.
- Sir Robert Walpole, who was the first Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742.

### The rebellion of the clans

- In 1745 there was another attempt to put a **Stuart** king back on the throne in place of George I’s son, George II. Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), the grandson of James II, landed in Scotland. He was supported by clansmen from the Scottish highlands and raised an army.
- Charles initially had some successes but was defeated by George II’s army at the Battle of **Culloden** in 1746. Charles escaped back to Europe.
- The clans lost a lot of their power and influence after Culloden.
- Chieftains became landlords if they had the favour of the English king, and clansmen became tenants who had to pay for the land they used.
- **‘Highland Clearances’**: Many Scottish landlords destroyed individual small farms (known as **‘crofts’**) to make space for large flocks of sheep and cattle. Evictions became very common in the early 19th century. Many Scottish people left for North America at this time. 

### The Enlightenment

- the Enlightenment: During the 18th century, new ideas about politics, philosophy and science were developed.
- Many of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment were Scottish.
  - Adam Smith developed ideas about economics which are still referred to today.
  - David Hume’s ideas about human nature continue to influence philosophers.
  - James Watt’s work on steam power, helped the progress of the Industrial Revolution.
- One of the most important principles of the Enlightenment was that everyone should have the right to their **own political and religious beliefs** and that the state should not try to dictate to them. This continues to be an important principle in the UK today.

### The Industrial Revolution

- Before the 18th century, **agriculture** was the biggest source of employment in Britain. There were many cottage industries, where people worked from home to produce goods such as **cloth** and **lace**.
- The Industrial Revolution: the rapid development of industry in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries.
- Britain was the **first** country to industrialise on a large scale. It happened because of the development of machinery and the use of steam power. Agriculture and the manufacturing of goods became mechanised. This made things more efficient and increased production.
- Coal and other raw materials were needed to power the new factories. Many people moved from the countryside and started working in the mining and manufacturing industries.
- The development of the **Bessemer process** for the mass production of steel led to the development of the shipbuilding industry and the railways.
- Manufacturing jobs became the main source of employment in Britain.
- **Canals** were built to link the factories to towns and cities and to the ports, particularly in the new industrial areas in the middle and north of England, to transport raw materials and manufactured goods.
- Working conditions during the Industrial Revolution were very **poor**. There were no laws to protect employees, who were often forced to work long hours in dangerous situations. Children also worked and were treated in the same way as adults. Sometimes they were treated even more harshly.
- Colonisation:
  - Captain James Cook mapped the coast of Australia and a few colonies were established there.
  - Britain gained control over Canada.
  - the East India Company, originally set up to **trade**, gained control of large parts of India. - Colonies began to be established in southern Africa.
- Britain traded all over the world and began to import more goods.
  - Sugar and tobacco came from North America and the West Indies;
  - textiles, tea and spices came from India and Indonesia.
- Trading and settlements overseas sometimes brought Britain into conflict with other countries, particularly **France**, which was expanding and trading in a similar way in many of the same areas of the world.

### The slave trade

- This commercial expansion and prosperity was sustained in part by the booming slave trade. While slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry, dominated by Britain and the American colonies.
- Slaves came primarily from West Africa. Travelling on British ships in horrible conditions, they were taken to **America and the Caribbean**, where they were made to work on **tobacco and sugar plantations**.
- The living and working conditions for slaves were very bad. Many slaves tried to escape and others revolted against their owners in protest at their terrible treatment.
- Quakers: They set up the first formal anti-slavery groups in the late 1700s, and they petitioned Parliament to ban the practice. 
- William Wilberforce, an evangelical Christian and a member of Parliament, also played an important part in changing the law. Along with other abolitionists (people who supported the abolition of slavery), he succeeded in turning public opinion against the slave trade.
- In 1807, it became illegal to trade slaves in British ships or from British ports
- In 1833 the Emancipation Act abolished slavery throughout the British Empire. The Royal Navy stopped slave ships from other countries, freed the slaves and punished the slave traders.
- After 1833, 2 million Indian and Chinese workers were employed to replace the freed slaves. They worked:
  - on sugar plantations in the Caribbean
  - in mines in South Africa
  - on railways in East Africa
  - in the army in Kenya

### The American War of Independence

- By the 1760s, there were substantial British colonies in North America.
- The colonies were wealthy and largely in control of their own affairs. Many of the colonist families had originally gone to North America in order to have religious freedom. They were well educated and interested in ideas of liberty.
- The British government wanted to tax the colonies. The colonists saw this as an attack on their freedom and said there should be ‘no taxation without representation’ in the British Parliament.
- Parliament tried to compromise by repealing some of the taxes, but relationships between the British government and the colonies continued to worsen.
- In 1776, 13 American colonies declared their independence, stating that people had a right to establish their own governments. The colonists eventually defeated the British army.
- In 1783, Britain recognised the colonies’ independence.

### War with France

- In 1789, there was a revolution in France and the new French government soon declared war on Britain. Napoleon, who became Emperor of France, continued the war.
- In 1805, Britain’s navy fought against combined French and Spanish fleets, winning the Battle of **Trafalgar** . **Admiral Nelson** was in charge of the British fleet at Trafalgar and was killed in the battle. Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London, is a monument to him. His ship, **HMS Victory**, can be visited in Portsmouth.
- In 1815, the French Wars ended with the defeat of the Emperor Napoleon by the Duke of **Wellington** at the Battle of Waterloo (by British army). Wellington was known as the Iron Duke and later became Prime Minister.

### The Union Flag

- Although Ireland had had the same monarch as England and Wales since **Henry VIII**, it had remained a separate country.
- In 1801, Ireland became unified with England, Scotland and Wales after the Act of Union of 1800.
- The Union Flag is often called the Union **Jack**. The flag combined crosses associated with England, Scotland and Ireland. It is still used today as the official flag of the UK.
- The Union Flag consists of three crosses:
  - The cross of St George, patron saint of England, is a red cross on a white ground.
  - The cross of St Andrew, patron saint of Scotland, is a diagonal white cross on a blue ground.
  - The cross of St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, is a diagonal red cross on a white ground.
- There is also an official Welsh flag, which shows a **Welsh dragon**. The Welsh dragon does not appear on the Union Flag because, when the first Union Flag was created in **1606** from the flags of Scotland and England, the Principality of Wales was already united with England.

### The Victorian Age

- In 1837, Queen Victoria became queen of the UK at the age of 18. She reigned until 1901, almost 64 years. 
- Her reign is known as the Victorian Age.
- It was a time when Britain increased in power and influence abroad. Within the UK, the middle classes became increasingly significant and a number of reformers led moves to improve conditions of life for the poor.
- During the Victorian period, **the British Empire** grew to cover:
  - all of India
  - Australia
  - large parts of Africa
- It became the largest empire the world has ever seen, with an estimated population of more than **400 million** people.
- Many people were encouraged to leave the UK to settle overseas. Between 1853 and 1913, as many as **13 million** British citizens left the country.
- People continued to come to Britain from other parts of the world. For example:
  - between 1870 and 1914, around **120, 000** Russian and Polish Jews came to Britain to escape persecution. Many settled in **London’s East End** and in **Manchester** and **Leeds**.
  - People from the Empire, including India and Africa, also came to Britain to live, work and study.
- Britain continued to be a great **trading** nation. The government began to promote policies of free trade, abolishing a number of taxes on imported goods. One example of this was the repealing of the **Corn Laws** in 1846. These had prevented the import of cheap grain. The reforms helped the
development of the British industry, because raw materials could now be imported cheaply.
- In 1847, the number of hours that women and children could work was limited by law to **10** hours per day. Better housing began to be built for workers. Working conditions in factories gradually became better. 
- Transport links also improved, enabling goods and people to move more easily around the country.
- British industry led the world in the 19th century. The UK produced more than half of the world’s **iron**, **coal** and **cotton cloth**.
- The UK also became a centre for financial services, including **insurance** and **banking**.
- In 1851, the Great Exhibition opened in Hyde Park in the Crystal Palace, a huge building made of steel and glass. Exhibits ranged from huge machines to handmade goods. Countries from all over the world showed their goods but most of the objects were made in Britain.
- Crimean War: From 1853 to 1856, Britain fought with Turkey and France against **Russia**. It was the **first** war to be extensively covered by the media through news stories and photographs. The conditions were very poor and many soldiers died from illnesses they caught in the hospitals, rather than from war wounds. Queen Victoria introduced the **Victoria Cross** medal during this war. It honours acts of valour by soldiers.
- Conditions in Ireland were not as good as in the rest of the UK. **2/3** of the population still depended on farming to make their living, often on very small plots of land. Many depended on potatoes as a large part of their diet.
- In the middle of the century the **potato** crop failed, and Ireland suffered a famine. **1 million** people died from disease and starvation. **1.5 million** left Ireland. Some emigrated to the United States and others came to England.
- By 1861 there were large populations of Irish people in cities such as Liverpool, London, Manchester and Glasgow.
- The Irish Nationalist movement had grown strongly through the 19th century.
  - Some, such as **the Fenians**, favoured complete independence.
  - Others, such as **Charles Stuart Parnell**, advocated ‘Home Rule’, in which Ireland would remain in the UK but have its own parliament.
- The Reform Act of 1832: As the middle classes in the wealthy industrial towns and cities grew in influence, they began to demand more political power. The act had greatly increased the number of people with the right to vote. The act also abolished the old **pocket and rotten boroughs** and more parliamentary seats were given to the towns and cities.
- There was a permanent shift of political power from the countryside to the towns but voting was still based on ownership of the property. This meant that members of the **working class** were still unable to vote.
- the Chartists: The Chartists (campaigners) presented petitions to Parliament to demand the vote for the working classes and other people without property. At first they seemed to be unsuccessful, but in 1867 there was another **Reform Act**. This created many more urban seats in Parliament and reduced the amount of property that people needed to have before they could vote. However, the majority of men still did not have the right to vote and no women could vote.
- Politicians realised that the increased number of voters meant that they needed to persuade people to vote for them if they were to be sure of being elected to Parliament. The political parties began to create organisations to reach out to ordinary voters. **Universal suffrage** (the right of every adult, male or female, to vote) followed in the next century.

|Time|Notes|
|---|---|
|Until 1870|when a woman got married, her earnings, property and money automatically belonged to her husband.|
|1870 and 1882|**Acts of Parliament** gave wives the right to keep their own earnings and property.|
|In the late 19th and early 20th centuries|an increasing number of women campaigned and demonstrated for greater rights and, in particular, the right to vote. They formed the women’s suffrage movement and became known as the **‘suffragettes’**.|

### The future of the Empire

- Although the British Empire continued to grow until the 1920s, there was already discussion in the late 19th century about its future direction. Supporters of expansion believed that the Empire benefited Britain through increased trade and commerce. Others thought the Empire had become over-expanded and that the frequent conflicts in many parts of the Empire, such as India’s north-west frontier or southern Africa, were a drain on resources. Yet the great majority of British people believed in the Empire as a force for good in the world.
- The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 made the discussions about the future of the Empire more urgent. The British went to war in **South Africa** with settlers from the **Netherlands** called the Boers. The Boers fought fiercely and the war went on for over three years. Many died in the fighting and many more from disease. There was some public sympathy for the Boers and people began to question whether the Empire could continue. As different parts of the Empire developed, they won greater freedom and autonomy from Britain.
- Eventually, by the second half of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from Empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence. 

## The 20th century

### The First World War

- The early 20th century was a time of optimism in Britain.
  - The nation, with its expansive Empire, well-admired navy, thriving industry and strong political institutions, was what is now known as a global ‘superpower’.
  - Financial help for the unemployed,
  - old-age pensions
  - free school meals
  - various laws were passed to improve safety in the workplace;
  - town planning rules were tightened to prevent the further development of slums;
  - better support was given to mothers and their children after divorce or separation.
  - Local government became more democratic and a salary for members of Parliament (MPs) was introduced for the first time, making it easier for more people to take part in public life.
- On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated. This set off a chain of events leading to the First World War (1914-18). But while the assassination provided the trigger for war, other factors – such as a growing sense of nationalism in many European states; increasing militarism; imperialism; and the division of the major European powers into two camps – all set the conditions for war.
- The conflict was centred in Europe, but it was a global war involving nations from around the world. The Allies fought against the Central Powers.
- Allied Powers:
  - Britain
  - France,
  - Russia,
  - Japan,
  - Belgium,
  - Serbia
  - and later...
  - Greece,
  - Italy,
  - Romania
  - United States.
- Central Powers:
  - Germany
  - Austro-Hungarian Empire
  - Ottoman Empire
  - (and later...) Bulgaria
- The whole of the British Empire was involved in the conflict – for example, more than a million Indians fought on behalf of Britain in lots of different countries, and around **40, 000** were killed.
- Men from the West Indies, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada also fought with the British. 
- Millions of people were killed or wounded, with more than 2 million British casualties.
- One battle, the British attack of the **Somme** in July 1916, resulted in about **60,000** British casualties on the first day alone.
- The First World War ended at 11.00 am on 11th November 1918 with victory for Britain and its allies.

### The partition of Ireland

|Time|Events|
|---|---|
|1913|the British government promised **‘Home Rule’** for Ireland. The proposal was to have a self-governing Ireland with its own parliament but still part of the UK. A Home Rule Bill was introduced in Parliament. It was opposed by the Protestants in the north of Ireland, who threatened to resist Home Rule by force.|
|1916|there was an uprising (the **Easter Rising**) against the British in Dublin. The leaders of the uprising were executed under military law. A guerrilla war against the British army and the police in Ireland followed.|
|1921|a peace treaty was signed|
|1922|Ireland became two countries. The six countries in the north which were mainly Protestant remained part of the UK under the name Northern Ireland. The rest of Ireland became the Irish Free State.|
|1949|Ireland had its own government and became a republic in 1949.|

- There were people in both parts of Ireland who disagree with the split between the North and the South. They still wanted Ireland to be one independent country. Years of disagreement led to a terror campaign in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.
- **‘the Troubles’**: The conflict between those wishing for full Irish independence and those wishing to remain loyal to the British government.

### The inter-war period

- In the 1920s, many people’s living conditions got better. There were improvements in public housing and new homes were built in many towns and cities.
- In 1929, the world entered the ‘Great Depression’ and some parts of the UK suffered mass unemployment. The effects of the depression of the 1930s were felt differently in different parts of the UK. The traditional heavy industries such as shipbuilding were badly affected but new
industries – including the automobile and aviation industries – developed.
- As prices generally fell, those in work had more money to spend. Car ownership doubled from 1 million to 2 million between 1930 and 1939.
- Many new houses were built.
- Cultural blossoming:
  - writers: Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
  - economist: John Maynard Keynes published influential new theories of economics.
  - The BBC started radio broadcasts in 1922 and began the world’s first regular television service in 1936.

### The Second World War

- Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933. He believed that the conditions imposed on Germany by the Allies after the First World War were unfair; he also wanted to conquer more land for the German people. He set about renegotiating treaties, building up arms, and testing Germany’s military strength in nearby countries. The British government tried to avoid another war.
- When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war in order to stop his aggression.
- The war was initially fought between the Axis powers (fascist Germany and Italy and the Empire of Japan) and the Allies.
- Axis powers:
  - fascist Germany
  - Italy
  - the Empire of Japan
- Allies:
  - the UK
  - France
  - Poland
  - Australia
  - New Zealand
  - Canada
  - the Union of South Africa
- Having occupied Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, Hitler followed his invasion of Poland by taking control of Belgium and the Netherlands. Then, in 1940, German forces defeated allied troops and advanced through France. At this time of national crisis, Winston Churchill became Prime Minister and Britain’s war leader. 
- As France fell, the British decided to evacuate British and French solders from France in a huge naval operation. Many civilian volunteers in small pleasure and fishing boats from Britain helped the Navy to rescue more than **300,000** men from the beaches around **Dunkirk**. Although many lives and a lot of equipment were lost, the evacuation was a success and meant that Britain was better able to continue the fight against the Germans. The evacuation gave rise to the phrase **‘the Dunkirk spirit’**.
- From the end of June 1940 until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Britain and the Empire stood almost alone against Nazi Germany.
- the Battle of Britain: Hitler wanted to invade Britain, but before sending in troops, Germany needed to control the air campaign against Britain, but the British resisted with their fighter planes and eventually won the crucial aerial battle against the Germans, in the summer of 1940. The most important planes used by the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain were the **Spitfire** and the **Hurricane** – which were designed and built in Britain.
- Blitz: Despite this crucial victory, the German air force was able to continue bombing London and other British cities at night-time. **Coventry** was almost totally destroyed and a great deal of damage was done in other cities, especially in the **East End of London**.
- the Blitz spirit: Despite the destruction, there was a strong national spirit of resistance in the UK. It is still used today to describe Britons pulling together in the face of adversity.
- At the same time as defending Britain, the British military was fighting the Axis on many other fronts. In Singapore, the Japanese defeated the British and then occupied Burma, threatening India. - The United States entered the war when the Japanese bombed its naval base at Pearl Harbor in December **1941**.
- That same year, Hitler attempted the largest invasion in history by attacking the Soviet Union. It was a fierce conflict, with huge losses on **both** sides. German forces were ultimately repelled by the Soviets, and the damage they sustained proved to be a pivotal point in the war.
- The allied forces gradually gained the upper hand, winning significant victories in North Africa and Italy. German losses in the Soviet Union, combined with the support of the Americans, meant that the Allies were eventually strong enough to attack Hitler’s forces in Western Europe.
- On 6 June 1944, allied forces landed in **Normandy** (this event is often referred to as **‘D-Day’**). Following victory on the beaches of Normandy, the allied forces pressed on through France and eventually into Germany.
- May 1945, The Allies comprehensively defeated **Germany**.
- August 1945, The war against **Japan** ended when the United States dropped its newly developed atom bombs on the Japanese cities of **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki**. Scientists led by **Ernest Rutherford**, working at **Manchester** and then **Cambridge** University, were the first to ‘split the atom’ and took part in the **Manhattan Project** in the **United States**, which developed the
atomic bomb.

# The development of British democracy

- Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say. This might be by **direct voting** or by **choosing representatives** to make decisions on their behalf.
- At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today. Although there were elections to select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small group of people could vote. They were men who were over **21** years of age and who **owned a certain amount of property**.
- The franchise (that is, the number of people who had the right to vote) grew over the course of the 19th century and political parties began to involve ordinary men and women as members.
- In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the **Chartists** campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:
  - for every man to have the vote
  - elections every year
  - for all regions to be equal in the electoral system
  - secret ballots
  - for any man to be able to stand as an MP
  - for MPs to be paid.
- At the time, the campaign was generally seen as a failure.
- However, by **1918** most of these reforms had been adopted. The voting franchise was also extended to women over **30**, and then in 1928 to men and women over **21**. In 1969, the voting age was reduced to **18** for men and women.

## The British constitution

- A constitution is a set of **principles** by which a country is governed. It includes all of the institutions that are responsible for running the country and how their power is kept in check.
- The constitution also includes **laws and conventions**.
- The British constitution is **not written down** in any single document, and therefore it is described as **‘unwritten’**. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France, has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government. Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of years. Some people believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten constitution allows for more flexibility and better government.

## Constitutional institutions

- In the UK, there are several different parts of government. The main ones are:
  - the monarchy
  - Parliament (the House of Commons and the House of Lords)
  - the Prime Minister
  - the cabinet
  - the judiciary (courts)
  - the police
  - the civil service
  - local government.
- In addition, there are devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that have the power to legislate on certain issues.

## The monarchy

- Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK.
- She is also the monarch or head of state for many countries in the Commonwealth.
- The UK has a **constitutional monarchy**. This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but **appoints the government**, which the people have chosen in a democratic election. The monarch invites the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs, or the leader of a coalition between more than one party, to become the Prime Minister.
- The monarch has **regular** meetings with the Prime Minister and can **advise, warn and encourage**, but the decisions on government policies are made by the **Prime Minister and cabinet**.
- The Queen has reigned since her father’s death in **1952**, and in 2012 she celebrated her **Diamond Jubilee** (**60** years as queen). She is married to Prince Philip, the Duke of **Edinburgh**. Her eldest son, Prince **Charles** (the Prince of **Wales**), is the heir to the throne.
- The Queen has important ceremonial roles, such as the **opening of the new parliamentary session** each year. On this occasion the Queen makes a speech which summarises the government’s policies for the year ahead. **All Acts of Parliament** are made in her name.
- The Queen represents the UK to the rest of the world. She:
  - receives foreign ambassadors and high commissioners,
  - entertains visiting heads of state,
  - and makes state visits overseas in support of diplomatic and economic relationships with other countries.
- The Queen has an important role in providing stability and continuity. While governments and Prime Ministers change regularly, the Queen continues as head of state. She provides a focus for national identity and pride, which was demonstrated through the celebrations of her Jubilee.

### The national anthem

- The National Anthem of the UK is ‘God Save the Queen’. It is played at important national occasions and at events attended by the Queen or the Royal Family.
- The first verse is:

<blockquote>

God save our gracious Queen!

Long live our noble Queen!

God save the Queen!

Send her victorious,

Happy and glorious,

Long to reign over us,

God save the Queen!

</blockquote>

- New citizens swear or affirm loyalty to the **Queen** as part of the citizenship ceremony.

### Oath of allegiance:

<blockquote>

I (name) swear by Almighty God that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to law.

</blockquote>

### Affirmation of allegiance:

<blockquote>

I (name) do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to law.

</blockquote>

## System of government

- The system of government in the UK is a **parliamentary democracy**.
- The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies.
- Voters in each constituency elect their **member of Parliament (MP)** in a **General Election**.
- All of the elected MPs form the **House of Commons**.
- Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party with the majority of MPs forms the government.
- If one party does not get a majority, two parties can join together to form a **coalition**.

## The House of Commons

- The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in Parliament because its members are democratically elected. The **Prime Minister and almost all the members of the cabinet** are members of the House of Commons (MPs). 
- Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a **small area** of the country. 
- MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:
  - represent everyone in their constituency
  - help to create new laws
  - scrutinise and comment on what the government is doing
  - debate important national issues.

## The House of Lords

- Members of the House of Lords, known as **peers**, are **not elected** by the people and do not represent a constituency. The role and membership of the House of Lords has changed over the last **50** years.
- Until **1958**, all peers were:
  - ‘hereditary’, which means they inherited their title, or
  - senior judges, or
  - bishops of the Church of England.
- Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime. These are called **life peers**. They have usually had an important career in politics, business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the **monarch** on the advice of the Prime Minister. They also include people nominated by the leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
- Since **1999**, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the House of Lords. They now elect a few of their number to represent them in the House of Lords.
- The House of Lords is normally **more independent** of the government than the House of Commons. It can **suggest amendments** or **propose new laws**, which are then discussed by MPs.
- The House of Lords checks laws that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit for purpose.
- It also holds the government to account to make sure that it is working in the best interests of the people.
- There are peers who are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in making and checking laws.
- The House of Commons has powers to overrule the House of Lords, but these are not used often.

## The Speaker

- Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the **Speaker**. This person is the **chief Officer** of the House of Commons.
- The Speaker is neutral and does not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents a constituency and deals with constituents’ problems like any other MP.
- The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a **secret ballot**.
- The Speaker keeps order during political debates to make sure the rules are followed. This includes making sure the opposition has a guaranteed amount of time to debate issues which it chooses. The Speaker also **represents Parliament** on ceremonial occasions.

## Elections

### UK elections

- MPs are elected at a **General Election**, which is held at least every **five** years.
- If an MP dies or resigns, there will be a fresh election, called a **byelection**, in his or her constituency.
- MPs are elected through a system called **‘first past the post’**. In each constituency, the candidate who gets the **most votes** is elected. The government is usually formed by the party that wins the majority of constituencies. If no party wins a majority, two parties may join together to form a **coalition**.

### European parliamentary elections

- Elections for the European Parliament are also held every **five** years. Elected members are called **members of the European Parliament (MEPs)**. Elections to the European Parliament use a system of **proportional representation**, where seats are allocated to each party in proportion to the total number of votes it has won.

## Contacting elected members

- All elected members have a duty to serve and represent their constituents.
- You can get contact details for all your representatives and their parties from your **local library** and from **www.parliament.uk**.
- MPs, Assembly members, members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and MEPs are also listed in **The Phone Book**, published by **BT**, and in **Yellow Pages**.
- You can contact MPs by **letter** or **telephone** at their constituency Office, or at their Office in the House of Commons: The House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA, telephone 020 7729 3000.
- In addition, many MPs, Assembly members, MSPs and MEPs hold regular local **‘surgeries’**, where constituents can go in person to talk about issues that are of concern to them. These surgeries are often advertised in the **local newspaper**.

# The government

## The Prime Minister

- The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the political party in power. He or she appoints the members of the cabinet and has control over many important public appointments.
- The **official home** of the Prime Minister is **10 Downing Street**, in central London, near the Houses of Parliament. He or she also has a country house outside London called **Chequers**.
- The Prime Minister can be changed if the MPs in the governing party decide to do so, or if he or she wishes to resign. The Prime Minister usually resigns if his or her party loses a **General Election**.

## The cabinet

- The Prime Minister appoints about **20** senior MPs to become **ministers** in charge of departments. These include:

|Title|Responsible for|
|---|---|
|Chancellor of the Exchequer|economy|
|Home Secretary|crime, policing and immigration|
|Foreign Secretary|managing relationships with foreign countries|
|other ministers (called ‘Secretaries of State’)|subjects such as education, health and defence|

- These ministers form the **cabinet**, a committee which usually meets **weekly** and makes important decisions about government policy. Many of these decisions have to be **debated** or **approved** by **Parliament**.
- Each department also has a number of other ministers, called **Ministers of State** and **Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State**, who take charge of particular areas of the department’s work.

## The opposition

- The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition. The leader of the opposition usually becomes Prime Minister if his or her party wins the next General Election.
- The leader of the opposition leads his or her party in pointing out what they see as the government’s failures and weaknesses. One important opportunity to do this is at **Prime Minister’s Questions**, which takes place **every week** while Parliament is sitting.
- The leader of the opposition also appoints senior opposition MPs to be **‘shadow ministers’**. They form the **shadow cabinet** and their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.

## The party system

- Anyone aged 18 or over can **stand for election** as an MP but they are unlikely to win unless they have been nominated to represent one of the major political parties. These are:
  - the Conservative Party,
  - the Labour Party,
  - the Liberal Democrats,
  - or one of the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
- There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties. They are called **‘independents’** and usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
- The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their debates, contribute to their costs, and help at elections for Parliament or for local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold policy-making conferences **every year**.
- **Pressure and lobby groups** are organisations which try to influence government policy. They play an important role in politics.
  - Some are representative organisations such as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which represents the views of British business.
  - Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace) or human rights (for example, Liberty).

## The civil service

- Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies. They also deliver public services. Civil servants are accountable to ministers. They are chosen on merit and are **politically neutral** – they are not political appointees.
- People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other jobs in the UK.
- Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication and a commitment to the civil service and its core values. These are:
  - integrity
  - honesty
  - objectivity
  - impartiality (including being politically neutral).

## Local government

- Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils, often called ‘local authorities’. Some areas have both **district and county councils**, which have different functions. Most large towns and cities have a **single local authority**.
- Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas. They are funded
  - by money from central government
  - by local taxes.
- Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the **ceremonial leader** of the council.
- In some towns, a mayor is elected to be the effective leader of the administration.
- London has **33** local authorities, with the **Greater London Authority** and the **Mayor of London** coordinating policies across the capital.
- For most local authorities, local elections for councillors are held in **May** **every year**. Many candidates stand for council election as members of a political party.

## The media and government

- Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on **television** and published in **official reports** called **Hansard**.
- Written reports can be found in **large libraries** and at **www.parliament.uk**.
- Most people get information about political issues and events from newspapers (often called ‘the press’), television, radio and the internet.
- The UK has a **free press**. This means that what is written in newspapers is free from government control. Some newspaper owners and editors hold strong political opinions and run campaigns to try to influence government policy and public opinion.
- By law, **radio** and **television** coverage of the political parties must be **balanced** and so equal time has to be given to rival viewpoints.

## Who can vote?

- The UK has had a fully democratic voting system since **1928**.
- The present voting age of 18 was set in **1969** and (with a few exceptions) all UK-born and naturalised adult citizens have the right to vote.
- Adult citizens of the UK, and **citizens of the Commonwealth** and the **Irish Republic** who are **resident in** the UK, can vote in **all** public elections.
- Adult citizens of other EU states who are resident in the UK can vote in all elections **except General Elections**.

## The electoral register

- To be able to vote in a parliamentary, local or European election, you must have your name on the electoral register.
- If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local council electoral registration Office. This is usually based at your local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere).
- If you don’t know which local authority you come under, you can find out by visiting www.aboutmyvote.co.uk and entering your postcode. You can also download voter registration forms in English, Welsh and some other languages.
- The electoral register is updated **every year** in **September or October**. An **electoral registration form** is sent to every household and this has to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident in the household and eligible to vote.
- In Northern Ireland a different system operates. This is called **‘individual registration’** and all those entitled to vote must complete their own registration form. Once registered, people stay on the register provided their personal details do not change. For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website at www.eoni.org.uk
- By law, each local authority has to make its electoral register available for anyone to look at, although this has to be supervised. The register is kept at each local electoral registration Office (or council Office in England and Wales). It is also possible to see the register at some public buildings such as libraries.

## Where to vote

### Polling station with a ballot box displayed

- People vote in elections at places called **polling stations**, or **polling places** in Scotland.
- Before the election you will be sent a **poll card**. This tells you where your polling station or polling place is and when the election will take place.
- On election day, the polling station or place will be open from **7.00 am until 10.00 pm**.
- When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address. In Northern Ireland you will also have to show **photographic identification**. You will then get your **ballot paper**, which you take to a **polling booth** to fill in privately. You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you vote for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on the ballot paper. Once you have completed it, put it in the **ballot box**.
- If it is difficult for you to get to a polling station or polling place, you can register for a **postal ballot**. Your ballot paper will be sent to your home before the election. You then fill it in and post it back. You can choose to do this when you register to vote.

## Standing for office

- Members of the House of Lords may not stand for election to the House of Commons but are eligible for all other public Offices.

## Visiting Parliament and the devolved administrations

### The UK Parliament

- The public can listen to debates in the Palace of Westminster from public galleries in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
- You can write to your **local MP** in advance to ask for tickets or you can **queue on the day** at the public entrance. Entrance is free.
- Sometimes there are long queues for the House of Commons and people have to wait for at least one to two hours. It is usually easier to get in to the House of Lords.
- You can find further information on the UK Parliament website at www.parliament.uk.
