**Catherine Howard** was a **cousin** of **Anne Boleyn**.

**Stone Age**: The first people to live in Britain were **hunter-gatherers**.

Throughout the 1990s, Britain played a leading role in coalition forces involved in the liberation of Kuwait, following the Iraqi invasion in 1990, and the conflict in the former Republic of Yugoslavia.

In the Middle Ages, **Knights**, who were usually **smaller landowners**, and **wealthy people** from towns and cities were elected to sit in the **House of Commons**.

During the Middle Ages, England was an important trading nation and people came to England from abroad to trade and also to work. Many had special skills:
- weavers from France,
- engineers from Germany,
- glass manufacturers from Italy
- and canal builders from Holland.

The Parliament developed in Scotland in the Middle Ages had three Houses, called **Estates**:
- the lords,
- the commons
- and the clergy.

The Middle Ages (or the medieval period) was a time of almost **constant war**.

In the Middle Ages, the numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts, known as **Houses** were established. These were the House of the **Commons** and the House of the **Lords**.

In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a **strong middle class**.

Queen Mary was a devout **Catholic** and persecuted **Protestants** (for this reason, she became known as ‘Bloody Mary’).

In the **late 1970s**, the post-war economic boom came to an end.

For most people, the right amount of income tax is automatically taken from their income from employment by their employer and paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the government department that collects taxes. This system is called **“Pay As You Earn” (PAYE)**.

Money raised from income tax pays for government services such as roads, education, police and the armed forces.

# A Long and Illustrious History

## Early Britain

### Stone Age

- hunter-gatherers: the first people to live in Britain.
- For much of the Stone Age, Britain was connected to the
continent by a **land bridge**. People came and went, following the herds of
deer and horses which they hunted.
- The first farmers built houses, tombs and monuments on the land.
- Survived Stone Age sites:
  - **Stonehenge** (a monument, World Heritage Site), still stands in what is now the English county of **Wiltshire**. Stonehenge was probably a special gathering place for **seasonal ceremonies**.
  - **Skara Brae on Orkney**, off the **north** coast of **Scotland**, is the best preserved prehistoric village in northern Europe, and has helped archaeologists to understand more about how people lived near the end of the Stone Age. 

### Bronze Age

- People lived in **roundhouses** and buried their dead in tombs called **round barrows**.
- The people were accomplished metalworkers who made many beautiful objects in bronze and gold, including tools, ornaments and weapons.

### Iron

- people learned how to make weapons and tools out of iron.
- People still lived in **roundhouses** grouped together into **larger settlements**, and sometimes defended sites called **hill forts**.
- A very impressive hill fort can still be seen today at **Maiden Castle**, in the English county of **Dorset**. 
- Most people were **farmers, craft workers or warriors**.
- The language they spoke was part of the **Celtic** language family. Similar languages were spoken across Europe in the Iron Age and related languages are still spoken today in some parts of Wales, Scotland and Ireland.
- The people of the Iron Age had a sophisticated culture and economy. They made the **first coins** to be minted in Britain, some inscribed with the **names of Iron Age kings**. This marks the beginnings of British history. 

### The Romans

- In AD 43 the Emperor Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion. The Romans were successful in occupying almost all of Britain.
- Boudicca (a tribal leader, the queen of the Iceni in what is now eastern England) fought against the Romans. She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on **Westminster Bridge in London**, near the Houses of Parliament.
- **Scotland** were never conquered by the Romans.
- The Emperor **Hadrien** built a wall in the north of England to keep out the **Picts** (ancestors of the Scottish people). Included in the wall were a number of forts. Parts of Hadrien’s Wall, including the forts of **Housesteads** and **Vindolanda**, can still be seen. It is a popular area for walkers and is a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site.
- The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and introduced new plants and animals.

### The Anglo-Saxons

- Britain was again invaded by tribes from northern Europe:
  - the Jutes,
  - the Angles
  - and the Saxons.
- The languages they spoke are the basis of modern-day English.
- Sutton Hoo's (an Anglo-Saxon king) burial place is in modern Suffolk. This king was buried with treasure and armour, all placed in a **ship** which was then covered by a mound of earth.
- Parts of the west of Britain, including much of what is now Wales, and Scotland, remained free of Anglo-Saxon rule.
- The Anglo-Saxons were not Christians when they first came to Britain but, during this period, **missionaries** came to Britain to preach about Christianity.
- Missionaries from Ireland spread the religion in the north:
  - **St Patrick**, who would become the patron saint of Ireland,
  - **St Columba**, who founded a monastery on the island of Iona, off the coast of what is now Scotland.
  - **St Augustine** led missionaries from Rome, who spread Christianity in the south. St Augustine became the **first Archbishop of Canterbury**.

### The Vikings

- The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under **King Alfred the Great**, who defeated the Vikings.
- Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain – especially in the east and north of England in an area known as the **Danelaw** (many place names there, such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe come from the Viking languages).
- The Viking settlers mixed with local communities and some converted to Christianity.
- Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England, except for a short
period when there were Danish kings. The first of these was **Cnut**, also
named **Canute**.
- In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged the people to unite under one king, **Kenneth MacAlpin**. The term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.

## The Norman Conquest

- The Battle of Hastings in 1066 is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known as the **Bayeux Tapestry** (70 metres (230 feet) long, colored wool), which can still be seen in France today. 
- The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England and led to many changes in government and social structures in England.
- Norman French, the language of the new ruling class influenced the development of the English language as we know it today.
- Initially the Normans also conquered Wales, but the Welsh gradually won territory back.
- The Scots and the Normans fought on the border between England and Scotland; the Normans took over some land on the border but did not invade Scotland.
- **Domesday Book**: William sent people all over England to draw up lists of all the towns and villages. The people who lived there, who owned the land and what animals they owned were also listed. It still exists today and gives a picture of society in England just after the Norman Conquest.

## The Middle Ages

### War at home and abroad

- Middle Ages (or the medieval period):
  - end of the Roman Empire in AD 476 - 1485 (Broadly speaking).
  - the Norman Conquest (1066) - 1485 (the focus here).
- It was a time of almost constant war.
- The English kings fought with the Welsh, Scottish and Irish noblemen for
control of their lands.
- In Wales, the English were able to establish their rule.
  - By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been defeated.
  - English laws and the English language were introduced.
- Scotland remained unconquered by the English.
- At the beginning of the Middle Ages, Ireland was an independent country. The English first went to Ireland as troops to **help** the Irish king and remained to build their own settlements.
- During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad:
  - Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the **Holy Land**.
  - English kings also fought a long war with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years).

### Feudalism

- The Normans used a system of land ownership known as **feudalism**. The king gave land to his lords in return for help in war. Landowners had to send certain numbers of men to serve in the army. Some **peasants** had their own land but most were **serfs**. They had a small area of their lord’s land where they could grow food. In return, they had to work for their lord and could not move away.
- The same system developed in southern Scotland. In the north of Scotland and Ireland, land was owned by members of the **‘clans’** (prominent families).

### The Black Death

- In 1348, **1/3** of the population of England died and a similar proportion in Scotland and Wales.
- This was one of the worst disasters ever to strike Britain.
- Following the Black Death, the smaller population meant there was less need to grow **cereal crops**.
- There were **labour shortages** and peasants began to demand higher wages.
- New social classes appeared, including owners of large areas of land (later called the **gentry**), and people left the countryside to live in the towns. In the towns, growing wealth led to the development of a strong **middle class**.
- In Ireland, the Black Death killed many in the **Pale** and, for a time, the area controlled by the English became **smaller**.

### Legal and political changes

- In the Middle Ages, Parliament began to develop into the institution it is today. Its origins can be traced to the king’s council of advisers, which included important **noblemen** and the **leaders of the Church**.
- In England, parliaments were called for the king to consult his nobles, particularly when the king needed to raise money. The numbers attending Parliament increased and two separate parts, known as Houses, were established.
- House of Lords:
  - nobility
  - great landowners
  - bishops
- House of Commons (elected)
  - Knights, who were usually smaller landowners
  - wealthy people from towns and cities
- Only a small part of the population was able to join in electing the members of the Commons.
- A similar Parliament developed in Scotland. It had three Houses, called **Estates**:
  - the lords
  - the commons
  - the clergy
- This was also a time of development in the legal system. The principle that judges are independent of the government began to be established.
- In England, judges developed ‘common law’ by a process of **precedence** (that is, following previous decisions) and tradition.
- In Scotland, the legal system developed slightly differently and laws were ‘codified’ (that is, written down).

### A distinct identity

- English: graduallly combined by Norman French (spoken by the king and his noblemen) and Anglo-Saxon (spoken by peasants) after the Norman Conquest.
- Norman French words: ‘park’ and ‘beauty’
- Anglo-Saxon words: ‘apple’, ‘cow’ and ‘summer’
- In modern English there are often two words with very similar meanings, one from French and one from AngloSaxon. ‘Demand’ (French) and ‘ask’ (Anglo-Saxon) are examples.
- Canterbury Tales was one of the first books to be printed by **William Caxton**, the first person in England to print books using a printing press. Many of the stories are still popular. Some have been made into plays and television programmes.
- In Scotland, many people continued to speak Gaelic and the Scots language also developed. A number of poets began to write in the Scots language. One example is **John Barbour**, who wrote *The Bruce* about the Battle of **Bannockburn**.
- Castles were built in many places in Britain and Ireland, partly for **defence**. Today many are in ruins, although some, such as **Windsor** and **Edinburgh**, are still in use.
- Great cathedrals – for example, **Lincoln Cathedral** – were also built, and many of these are still used for worship.
- Several of the cathedrals had windows of stained glass, telling stories about the **Bible and Christian saints.** The glass in **York Minster** is a famous example.
- England was an important trading nation. English **wool** became a very important export.
- People came to England from abroad to trade and also to work. Many had special skills, such as:
  - weavers from France
  - engineers from Germany
  - glass manufacturers from Italy
  - canal builders from Holland

### The Wars of the Roses

- 1455 - 1485.
- House of Lancaster - House of York

# The development of British democracy

- Democracy is a system of government where the whole adult population gets a say. This might be by **direct voting** or by **choosing representatives** to make decisions on their behalf.
- At the turn of the 19th century, Britain was not a democracy as we know it today. Although there were elections to select members of Parliament (MPs), only a small group of people could vote. They were men who were over **21** years of age and who **owned a certain amount of property**.
- The franchise (that is, the number of people who had the right to vote) grew over the course of the 19th century and political parties began to involve ordinary men and women as members.
- In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the **Chartists** campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:
  - for every man to have the vote
  - elections every year
  - for all regions to be equal in the electoral system
  - secret ballots
  - for any man to be able to stand as an MP
  - for MPs to be paid.
- At the time, the campaign was generally seen as a failure.
- However, by **1918** most of these reforms had been adopted. The voting franchise was also extended to women over **30**, and then in 1928 to men and women over **21**. In 1969, the voting age was reduced to **18** for men and women.

## The British constitution

- A constitution is a set of **principles** by which a country is governed. It includes all of the institutions that are responsible for running the country and how their power is kept in check.
- The constitution also includes **laws and conventions**.
- The British constitution is **not written down** in any single document, and therefore it is described as **‘unwritten’**. This is mainly because the UK, unlike America or France, has never had a revolution which led permanently to a totally new system of government. Our most important institutions have developed over hundreds of years. Some people believe that there should be a single document, but others believe an unwritten constitution allows for more flexibility and better government.

## Constitutional institutions

- In the UK, there are several different parts of government. The main ones are:
  - the monarchy
  - Parliament (the House of Commons and the House of Lords)
  - the Prime Minister
  - the cabinet
  - the judiciary (courts)
  - the police
  - the civil service
  - local government.
- In addition, there are devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that have the power to legislate on certain issues.

## The monarchy

- Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state of the UK.
- She is also the monarch or head of state for many countries in the Commonwealth.
- The UK has a **constitutional monarchy**. This means that the king or queen does not rule the country but **appoints the government**, which the people have chosen in a democratic election. The monarch invites the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs, or the leader of a coalition between more than one party, to become the Prime Minister.
- The monarch has **regular** meetings with the Prime Minister and can **advise, warn and encourage**, but the decisions on government policies are made by the **Prime Minister and cabinet**.
- The Queen has reigned since her father’s death in **1952**, and in 2012 she celebrated her **Diamond Jubilee** (**60** years as queen). She is married to Prince Philip, the Duke of **Edinburgh**. Her eldest son, Prince **Charles** (the Prince of **Wales**), is the heir to the throne.
- The Queen has important ceremonial roles, such as the **opening of the new parliamentary session** each year. On this occasion the Queen makes a speech which summarises the government’s policies for the year ahead. **All Acts of Parliament** are made in her name.
- The Queen represents the UK to the rest of the world. She:
  - receives foreign ambassadors and high commissioners,
  - entertains visiting heads of state,
  - and makes state visits overseas in support of diplomatic and economic relationships with other countries.
- The Queen has an important role in providing stability and continuity. While governments and Prime Ministers change regularly, the Queen continues as head of state. She provides a focus for national identity and pride, which was demonstrated through the celebrations of her Jubilee.

### The national anthem

- The National Anthem of the UK is ‘God Save the Queen’. It is played at important national occasions and at events attended by the Queen or the Royal Family.
- The first verse is:

<blockquote>

God save our gracious Queen!

Long live our noble Queen!

God save the Queen!

Send her victorious,

Happy and glorious,

Long to reign over us,

God save the Queen!

</blockquote>

- New citizens swear or affirm loyalty to the **Queen** as part of the citizenship ceremony.

### Oath of allegiance:

<blockquote>

I (name) swear by Almighty God that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to law.

</blockquote>

### Affirmation of allegiance:

<blockquote>

I (name) do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that on becoming a British citizen, I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, her Heirs and Successors, according to law.

</blockquote>

## System of government

- The system of government in the UK is a **parliamentary democracy**.
- The UK is divided into parliamentary constituencies.
- Voters in each constituency elect their **member of Parliament (MP)** in a **General Election**.
- All of the elected MPs form the **House of Commons**.
- Most MPs belong to a political party, and the party with the majority of MPs forms the government.
- If one party does not get a majority, two parties can join together to form a **coalition**.

## The House of Commons

- The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two chambers in Parliament because its members are democratically elected. The **Prime Minister and almost all the members of the cabinet** are members of the House of Commons (MPs). 
- Each MP represents a parliamentary constituency, which is a **small area** of the country. 
- MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:
  - represent everyone in their constituency
  - help to create new laws
  - scrutinise and comment on what the government is doing
  - debate important national issues.

## The House of Lords

- Members of the House of Lords, known as **peers**, are **not elected** by the people and do not represent a constituency. The role and membership of the House of Lords has changed over the last **50** years.
- Until **1958**, all peers were:
  - ‘hereditary’, which means they inherited their title, or
  - senior judges, or
  - bishops of the Church of England.
- Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime. These are called **life peers**. They have usually had an important career in politics, business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the **monarch** on the advice of the Prime Minister. They also include people nominated by the leaders of the other main political parties or by an independent Appointments Commission for non-party peers.
- Since **1999**, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the House of Lords. They now elect a few of their number to represent them in the House of Lords.
- The House of Lords is normally **more independent** of the government than the House of Commons. It can **suggest amendments** or **propose new laws**, which are then discussed by MPs.
- The House of Lords checks laws that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit for purpose.
- It also holds the government to account to make sure that it is working in the best interests of the people.
- There are peers who are specialists in particular areas, and their knowledge is useful in making and checking laws.
- The House of Commons has powers to overrule the House of Lords, but these are not used often.

## The Speaker

- Debates in the House of Commons are chaired by the **Speaker**. This person is the **chief Officer** of the House of Commons.
- The Speaker is neutral and does not represent a political party, even though he or she is an MP, represents a constituency and deals with constituents’ problems like any other MP.
- The Speaker is chosen by other MPs in a **secret ballot**.
- The Speaker keeps order during political debates to make sure the rules are followed. This includes making sure the opposition has a guaranteed amount of time to debate issues which it chooses. The Speaker also **represents Parliament** on ceremonial occasions.

## Elections

### UK elections

- MPs are elected at a **General Election**, which is held at least every **five** years.
- If an MP dies or resigns, there will be a fresh election, called a **byelection**, in his or her constituency.
- MPs are elected through a system called **‘first past the post’**. In each constituency, the candidate who gets the **most votes** is elected. The government is usually formed by the party that wins the majority of constituencies. If no party wins a majority, two parties may join together to form a **coalition**.

### European parliamentary elections

- Elections for the European Parliament are also held every **five** years. Elected members are called **members of the European Parliament (MEPs)**. Elections to the European Parliament use a system of **proportional representation**, where seats are allocated to each party in proportion to the total number of votes it has won.

## Contacting elected members

- All elected members have a duty to serve and represent their constituents.
- You can get contact details for all your representatives and their parties from your **local library** and from **www.parliament.uk**.
- MPs, Assembly members, members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) and MEPs are also listed in **The Phone Book**, published by **BT**, and in **Yellow Pages**.
- You can contact MPs by **letter** or **telephone** at their constituency Office, or at their Office in the House of Commons: The House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA, telephone 020 7729 3000.
- In addition, many MPs, Assembly members, MSPs and MEPs hold regular local **‘surgeries’**, where constituents can go in person to talk about issues that are of concern to them. These surgeries are often advertised in the **local newspaper**.

# The government

## The Prime Minister

- The Prime Minister (PM) is the leader of the political party in power. He or she appoints the members of the cabinet and has control over many important public appointments.
- The **official home** of the Prime Minister is **10 Downing Street**, in central London, near the Houses of Parliament. He or she also has a country house outside London called **Chequers**.
- The Prime Minister can be changed if the MPs in the governing party decide to do so, or if he or she wishes to resign. The Prime Minister usually resigns if his or her party loses a **General Election**.

## The cabinet

- The Prime Minister appoints about **20** senior MPs to become **ministers** in charge of departments. These include:

|Title|Responsible for|
|---|---|
|Chancellor of the Exchequer|economy|
|Home Secretary|crime, policing and immigration|
|Foreign Secretary|managing relationships with foreign countries|
|other ministers (called ‘Secretaries of State’)|subjects such as education, health and defence|

- These ministers form the **cabinet**, a committee which usually meets **weekly** and makes important decisions about government policy. Many of these decisions have to be **debated** or **approved** by **Parliament**.
- Each department also has a number of other ministers, called **Ministers of State** and **Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State**, who take charge of particular areas of the department’s work.

## The opposition

- The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition. The leader of the opposition usually becomes Prime Minister if his or her party wins the next General Election.
- The leader of the opposition leads his or her party in pointing out what they see as the government’s failures and weaknesses. One important opportunity to do this is at **Prime Minister’s Questions**, which takes place **every week** while Parliament is sitting.
- The leader of the opposition also appoints senior opposition MPs to be **‘shadow ministers’**. They form the **shadow cabinet** and their role is to challenge the government and put forward alternative policies.

## The party system

- Anyone aged 18 or over can **stand for election** as an MP but they are unlikely to win unless they have been nominated to represent one of the major political parties. These are:
  - the Conservative Party,
  - the Labour Party,
  - the Liberal Democrats,
  - or one of the parties representing Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish interests.
- There are a few MPs who do not represent any of the main political parties. They are called **‘independents’** and usually represent an issue important to their constituency.
- The main political parties actively look for members of the public to join their debates, contribute to their costs, and help at elections for Parliament or for local government. They have branches in most constituencies and hold policy-making conferences **every year**.
- **Pressure and lobby groups** are organisations which try to influence government policy. They play an important role in politics.
  - Some are representative organisations such as the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), which represents the views of British business.
  - Others campaign on particular topics, such as the environment (for example, Greenpeace) or human rights (for example, Liberty).

## The civil service

- Civil servants support the government in developing and implementing its policies. They also deliver public services. Civil servants are accountable to ministers. They are chosen on merit and are **politically neutral** – they are not political appointees.
- People can apply to join the civil service through an application process, like other jobs in the UK.
- Civil servants are expected to carry out their role with dedication and a commitment to the civil service and its core values. These are:
  - integrity
  - honesty
  - objectivity
  - impartiality (including being politically neutral).

## Local government

- Towns, cities and rural areas in the UK are governed by democratically elected councils, often called ‘local authorities’. Some areas have both **district and county councils**, which have different functions. Most large towns and cities have a **single local authority**.
- Local authorities provide a range of services in their areas. They are funded
  - by money from central government
  - by local taxes.
- Many local authorities appoint a mayor, who is the **ceremonial leader** of the council.
- In some towns, a mayor is elected to be the effective leader of the administration.
- London has **33** local authorities, with the **Greater London Authority** and the **Mayor of London** coordinating policies across the capital.
- For most local authorities, local elections for councillors are held in **May** **every year**. Many candidates stand for council election as members of a political party.

## The media and government

- Proceedings in Parliament are broadcast on **television** and published in **official reports** called **Hansard**.
- Written reports can be found in **large libraries** and at **www.parliament.uk**.
- Most people get information about political issues and events from newspapers (often called ‘the press’), television, radio and the internet.
- The UK has a **free press**. This means that what is written in newspapers is free from government control. Some newspaper owners and editors hold strong political opinions and run campaigns to try to influence government policy and public opinion.
- By law, **radio** and **television** coverage of the political parties must be **balanced** and so equal time has to be given to rival viewpoints.

## Who can vote?

- The UK has had a fully democratic voting system since **1928**.
- The present voting age of 18 was set in **1969** and (with a few exceptions) all UK-born and naturalised adult citizens have the right to vote.
- Adult citizens of the UK, and **citizens of the Commonwealth** and the **Irish Republic** who are **resident in** the UK, can vote in **all** public elections.
- Adult citizens of other EU states who are resident in the UK can vote in all elections **except General Elections**.

## The electoral register

- To be able to vote in a parliamentary, local or European election, you must have your name on the electoral register.
- If you are eligible to vote, you can register by contacting your local council electoral registration Office. This is usually based at your local council (in Scotland it may be based elsewhere).
- If you don’t know which local authority you come under, you can find out by visiting www.aboutmyvote.co.uk and entering your postcode. You can also download voter registration forms in English, Welsh and some other languages.
- The electoral register is updated **every year** in **September or October**. An **electoral registration form** is sent to every household and this has to be completed and returned with the names of everyone who is resident in the household and eligible to vote.
- In Northern Ireland a different system operates. This is called **‘individual registration’** and all those entitled to vote must complete their own registration form. Once registered, people stay on the register provided their personal details do not change. For more information see the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland website at www.eoni.org.uk
- By law, each local authority has to make its electoral register available for anyone to look at, although this has to be supervised. The register is kept at each local electoral registration Office (or council Office in England and Wales). It is also possible to see the register at some public buildings such as libraries.

## Where to vote

### Polling station with a ballot box displayed

- People vote in elections at places called **polling stations**, or **polling places** in Scotland.
- Before the election you will be sent a **poll card**. This tells you where your polling station or polling place is and when the election will take place.
- On election day, the polling station or place will be open from **7.00 am until 10.00 pm**.
- When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address. In Northern Ireland you will also have to show **photographic identification**. You will then get your **ballot paper**, which you take to a **polling booth** to fill in privately. You should make up your own mind who to vote for. No one has the right to make you vote for a particular candidate. You should follow the instructions on the ballot paper. Once you have completed it, put it in the **ballot box**.
- If it is difficult for you to get to a polling station or polling place, you can register for a **postal ballot**. Your ballot paper will be sent to your home before the election. You then fill it in and post it back. You can choose to do this when you register to vote.

## Standing for office

- Members of the House of Lords may not stand for election to the House of Commons but are eligible for all other public Offices.

## Visiting Parliament and the devolved administrations

### The UK Parliament
